                        live video feed of the physical game board</span> using OpenCV and Python. It should identify cells and disks, display 
                        scores, detect hand movements for turn switches, and help rectify illegal moves.</p>

                    <h4>Initial (and Wrong) Approach</h4>
                        <p>Initially, I became overly fixated on using the Hough transform for grid line and cell detection, despite finding a 
                            more efficient alternative later on. This consumed nearly a quarter of the project's time.</p>
                        <h5>Image Processing</h5>
                            <div class="prototype-img">
                                <img src="img/wrong_approach.jpg" alt="wrong-approach" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Grayscale conversion replaced binary conversion due to the Hough transform's inability to distinguish between 
                                green and black with binary conversion, as there's no intermediate shade to represent green between black and 
                                white.</p>
                        <h5>Grid Detection</h5>
                            <div class="process-container">
                                <div class="process-img">
                                    <img src="img/wrong_approach_grid.png" alt="wrong-approach-grid" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="process-list">
                                    <ul class="unindented-ul">
                                        <li class="unindented-li">Applied Canny edge detection to grayscale video, creating an edge map.</li>

                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>I followed steps above for grid detection. However, <span class="highlight">like shadow detection and multiple 
                                lines for vertical partitions emerged</span>, shown in the image. Despite challenges, I moved forward to disk 
                                detection.</p>
                        <h5>Disk Detection</h5>
                            <div class="prototype-img">
                                <img src="img/wrong_approach_cell.jpg" alt="wrong-approach-cell" />
                            </div>
                            <p>The initial disk detection approach used thresholding, morphology, and the Hough transform. It <span class="highlight">
                                lestimated disk size based on grid cell length but struggled when the whole board appeared, mistaking it for a cell.
                                </span> Accurate grid line detection presented challenges, leading to the exploration of solutions like line 
                                merging and circle size thresholds.</p>
                    <h4>Final (and Right) Approach</h4>
                        <h5>Grid Detection</h5>
                            <div class="mri-img">
                                <img src="img/right_approach_grid.jpg" alt="right-approach-grid" style="width:60%;" />
                            </div>
                             <p>I eventually realized I could exploit the board's regularities. <span class="highlight">The refined algorithm 
                                used color filtering to detect the green board, employed contour detection and shape approximation to outline 
                                its shape, and established an accurate 8x8 grid.</span> This approach achieved near-perfect grid identification, 
                                as shown above.</p>
                        <h5>Disk Detection</h5>
                            <p>Using the same logic, I used the regularities of the disks, linking their side lengths to grid cells for color 
                                detection. This involved identifying corner points for each cell.</p>
                            <div class="mri-img">
                                <img src="img/right_approach_disk-1.jpg" alt="right-approach-cell" style="width:60%;" />
                            </div>
                                <p>I created an intersection_points set to gather all 81 intersection points on the grid lines. Sorting these by 
                                y-coordinates and then x-coordinates ordered them logically. This arrangement was validated using gradient-adjusted 
                                color tuples, ensuring correctness.</p>
                            <div class="prototype-img">
                                <img src="img/right_approach_disk-2.jpg" alt="right-approach-cell" />
                            </div>
                            <p>I initially connected all four corner points for precise color detection but encountered issues due to erroneous 
                                associations between lines and points. So, I switched to a rectangle-based method using two corner points.</p>
                            <div class="prototype-img">
                                <img src="img/right_approach_disk-3.jpg" alt="right-approach-cell" />
                            </div>
                            <p>The final algorithm extracted colors using masks and counted pixels to determine dominant colors, accurately 
                                portraying disk presence and grid layout. This process was demonstrated through output images and console 
                                messages.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Object Detection: Hand</h3>
                    <h4>Ditinguishing between Players</h4>
                        <p>Initially, I attempted to discern players by locating their hands using the board's position. However, I realized 
                            that identifying the direction of approach sufficed. A hand from the left meant Player 1; from the opposite side, 
                            Player 2.</p>
                        <div class="prototype-img">
                            <img src="img/hand_detection.jpg" alt="hand-detection" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Initially, my implementation accounted for a single hand, assuming one hand in the frame. Later, I expanded it to 
                            accommodate multiple hands as part of the strategy component.</p>
                    <h4>Timeout</h4>
                        <p><strong>Timeout</strong>, one of the two possible game-ending conditions, can arise from two scenarios:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>When no hand is detected during the timeout period.</li>
                                <li>When no move is detected during the timeout period.</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>After conducting several simulations with a friend acting as Player 2, I determined that a 30-second timeout limit 
                            would be optimal. To denote this duration, I employed a constant variable named TIME_LIMIT.</p>
                        <h4>No Hand Detected</h4>
                            <p>To track the hand detection time limit, I created a variable to store the timestamp of the last hand detection. 
                                When a hand is detected, this variable is updated with the current time. The player's number is displayed in 
                                the top left corner when a hand is detected. If the time between detections surpasses TIME_LIMIT, the game 
                                concludes, and the winner is declared alongside the termination reason.</p>
                        <h4>No Play Detected</h4>
                            <div class="process-container">
                                <div class="process-img">
                                    <img src="img/no_hand_timeout.png" alt="no_hand_timeout" />
                                </div>
                                <div class="process-list">
                                    <p><span class="highlight">A play was identified by a disk count increase on the board.</span> To handle 
                                        timeouts, I tracked the previous disk count as "prev_disk_num" and checked if the current count 
                                        exceeded it by 1 after a player's turn. Time of last play detection was stored as 
                                        "last_play_detected_time," updated when the count increased by one. If the time interval surpassed 
                                        TIME_LIMIT, the game ended, revealing the winner and termination reason.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>However, lighting-induced changes affected disk detection and led to premature game endings, as the program 
                                assumed no play within TIME_LIMIT. As a result of this, I excluded this scenario as a timeout cause.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Strategy: Spotting Illegal Moves (In Progress)</h3>
                    <h4>If Illegal, Do What?</h4>
                        <p>If an illegal move is detected, players are prompted for a new move. Ignoring this prompt won't affect the game, as 
                            the program's purpose is to aid scoring and gameplay. </p>
                        <p>Initially, warnings were console-based, but user feedback from a test round led to displaying them in the output 
                            video, incorporated in the final system.</p>
                    <h4>Identifying Player Turn</h4>
                        <p>Initially, turns were determined by the nearest hand to the board's center using one hand. However, I improved the 
                            system to consider multiple hands and account for hand-placement areas next to the board. Now, the system detects 
                            all hands, calculates the board's center, measures distances between hands and the center, and assigns player 
                            numbers based on proximity. This change guarantees players don't need to be concerned about their hands being 
                            visible when it's not their turn.</p>
                    <h4>Caputuring Illegal Moves</h4>
                        <h5>New Variables</h5>
                            <ul class="unindented-ul">
                                <li class="unindented-li"><strong>prev_grid_colors</strong>: a copy of grid_color in a 2D array format, 
                                    enabling comparison before and after pressing 's' to save updates.</li>
                                <li class="unindented-li"><strong>prev_player_num</strong>: initialized as 2, tracks the preceding player. 
                                    Player 2 plays before and after the leading Player 1.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h5>Ensuring Player Plays at Their Turn</h5>
                            <p>Using prev_player_num, if the current player number matches the list's first element (signifying the previous 
                                and current players are the same), a warning is shown on the frame. This alert continues until the correct 
                                player takes their turn.</p>
                        <h5>If curr_total_disk_num != prev_total_disk_num + 1</h5>
                            <p>Illegal moves that can disrupt the equality between the current total disk count and the previous total disk 
                                count plus one include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Players attempting to place multiple disks simultaneously.</li>
                                <li>Players attempting to place a disk in an occupied cell.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These two categories of illegal moves can be differentiated by the total number of disks on the board. The 
                                former involves more than prev_total_disk_num + 1 disks, while the latter involves exactly prev_total_disk_num 
                                disks.</p>

                    <h4>Flipping</h4>
                        <p>This step is still in progress.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Evaluation (In Progress)</h3>
                    <p>From a single round of Othello I played with a friend, the system accurately identified the player's disk count 98 out 
                        of 112 times, yielding an 87.5% accuracy rate. Yet, this assessment derives solely from one gaming instance. Also, the 
                        system requires further refinement to reliably detect illegal moves.</p>
                    <h4>Other Takeaways</h4>
                        <p>After playing Othello and discussing the score-keeping system's performance with a friend, following insights were 
                            gathered:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Board and disk detection is quite reliable.</li>
                            <li>Fatigue issue: Frequent 's' key presses for move legality checks can be physically tiring.</li>
                            <li>Strategy component reliability lacks: Detection accuracy of illegal moves varies. It's more sensitive in 
                                detecting disks placed atop each other or out-of-turn plays. For instance, it might warn when a player's hand 
                                pauses before placing a disk or erroneously detect illegal scenarios.</li>
                            <li>Unenforced illegal moves: Program prompts for corrections, but doesn't enforce the rule. Ignored prompts lead 
                                to potential inaccurate scores or game outcomes. Strategy identifies illegal moves post-execution instead of 
                                preventing them.</li>
                            <li>Turn detection using hand proximity: Identifying turns via hand position is practical, but errors might arise 
                                from simultaneous hand movement or misidentified hands.</li>
                            <li>Limited illegal move detection scope: Current program only spots specific illegal moves (e.g., multi-disk 
                                placement or non-empty cell). Other types may be unaddressed, impacting game accuracy.</li>
                            <li>Limited testing scope: The proposal lacks details on game testing frequency, lighting, and player diversity. 
                                More extensive testing can reveal strategy limitations.</li>
                            <li>Adding a reset functionality would be helpful.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h3 class="subheading">Conclusion & Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Evaluation confirms accurate grid and disk detection. However, system limitations persist, including manual 's' key 
                        legality checks and inconsistent disk detection, especially for black and white disks. Current hand-based turn 
                        assignment is also flawed, leading to incorrect turn warnings when hands briefly go undetected. Feedback highlights the 
                        need for an improved strategy, crucial for Othello's disk flipping. Without it, system effectiveness suffers...</p>
                    <p>A notable lesson learned is embracing broader problem-solving. Overcomplication hindered tasks; recognizing 64-square 
                        grid regularity could have eliminated the need for a physical board. Excessive focus on initial algorithm refinement 
                        overshadowed core problem essence.</p>
                    <p>Another takeaway: prioritize design before coding. Rushing to incorporate live video gameplay led to an unstructured 
                        program with an excessively lengthy main.py file. Cleaning and restructuring at project end took substantial time. </p>
