                <h3 class="subheading">Abstract</h3>
                    <p>The research evaluates different comfort aids' effectiveness in reducing patient discomfort during MRI scans. 
                        Participants tested mindfulness-based and distraction-based aids, along with a control group, in a mock MRI scanner 
                        for 5 minutes each. Comfort was assessed using heart rate tracking, PANAS questionnaires, and 5-point Likert scale 
                        ratings. Distraction was more effective than mindfulness, particularly visual distraction over audio. While averages 
                        indicate trends, individual preferences varied. Notably, participants grew more comfortable with each mock scan. 
                        Implications suggest MRI facilities prioritize distraction-based aids, particularly visual ones. Radiologists could 
                        allow patients to test multiple aids before choosing, and mock scanning practice might benefit MRI centers.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Many individuals undergo MRIs annually, yet discomfort is common. Research has explored comfort aids to alleviate 
                        MRI-related anxiety and prior studies mainly compare control and comfort aid groups. This study 
                        <strong>uniquely</strong> categorizes comfort aids as distraction-based (e.g., AV systems, music) and mindfulness 
                        (e.g., information, psychological support) and aims to compare their effectiveness.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Are mindfulness-based comfort aids or distraction-based strategies more 
                            effective at improving patient comfort?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The study hypothesizes that mindfulness strategies will outperform distraction-based methods in alleviating patient 
                        discomfort.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Methods</h3>
                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                        <p>Barnard College and Columbia University students were recruited through in-person methods. The final sample 
                            comprised 2 men and 2 women aged 19 to 22, averaging 20.75 years. One participant had prior MRI experience. 
                            Compensation included a $30 Amazon gift card for each participant.</p>
                    <h4>Experimental Design</h4>
                        <p>Using a within-subjects design, this study employed a randomized order for all 5 conditions to minimize order 
                            effects.</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Independent Variable</strong>: comfort aid type: no comfort aid (control), audio distraction (music), 
                                audio-visual distraction (watching TV), audio mindfulness (guided meditation), and visual mindfulness (relaxing,
                                in-bore galaxy projection).</li>
                            <li><strong>Depedent Variable</strong>: patient emotional state, determined by heart rate, PANAS scores, Likert 
                                reports, and interview responses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Procedure</h4>
                        <h5>Set Up</h5>
                            <p>The study was conducted in Columbia Zuckerman Institute’s mock MRI scanner. Each participant was assigned a 
                                randomized sequence of conditions (see Table 1). Subjects reviewed an emailed copy of the consent form before 
                                their study. Upon arrival, the researchers explained the consent form and study outline and gave participants 
                                the opportunity to ask any questions or opt out. Participants then signed the form.</p>
                            <p>Each scan was 5 minutes long. To mimic accurate MRI conditions during each scan, a recording of actual MRI 
                                sounds played loudly through the mock scanner’s sound system. The appropriate devices were connected per scan 
                                as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Participants wore earplugs to protect their hearing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Music:</strong> Participants listened to their chosen Pandora music playlist using Bluetooth over-ear headphones.</li>
                                <li><strong>TV:</strong> Participants watched their chosen Netflix show using headphones to hear and a mirror (angled on the head coil) to see the laptop behind the mock scanner.</li>
                                <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Participants listened to the Headspace meditation “Breathing into Stress” through headphones.</li>
                                <li><strong>Galaxy projection:</strong> The Encalife galaxy projector angled slowly-orbiting galaxies and stars into the mock scanner. Participants wore ear plugs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                                <img src="img/mri_order.png" alt="mri-order" style="width: 60%;" />
                            </div>
                        <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                            <p>During mock scans, participant heart rates were tracked using a FitBit, and emotions were gauged through PANAS 
                                questionnaires comprising 20 emotion-related inquiries. After each scan, participants used a 5-point scale 
                                (1 to 5) to rate their emotional states in PANAS questionnaires, which generated scores for positive and 
                                negative affect (PA and NA). Higher scores indicated heightened positive or negative feelings. Post the 5 
                                conditions testing, participants assessed comfort aid effectiveness using a 5-point Likert scale (1: very 
                                uncomfortable, 5: very comfortable). Researchers also conducted interviews with participants to gather 
                                insights on their experiences with each comfort aid.</p>
                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                                <img src="img/mri_figure1.png" alt="mri-figure1" style="width: 60%;" />
                            </div>
                <h3 class="subheading">Results</h3>
                    <h4>Likert Ratings Per Comfort Aid</h4>
                        <p>Figure 2 illustrates comfort ratings: Netflix (M=4) was most comfortable, followed by galaxy projection (M=3). 
                            Meditation and music tied for third (M=2.75), while no modifications ranked least comfortable (M=2). Figure 3 shows 
                            three participants favoring Netflix, galaxy projection and meditation being mid-rated, and no modifications and 
                            music least preferred by three participants. Figure 4 reveals distraction-based aids (M=3.38) were more comforting 
                            than mindfulness aids (M=2.88). Visual comfort aids (Netflix and galaxy projection) were most effective (M=3.5), 
                            whereas audio-only aids (music and meditation) were least comfortable (M=2.75).</p>

                            <img src="img/mri_figure2.png" alt="mri-figure2" style="width: 60%;" />
                        </div>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                            <img src="img/mri_figure3.png" alt="mri-figure3" style="width: 60%;" />
                        </div>
                    <h4>PANAS Scores</h4>
                        <p>The PANAS scores showed little variation, ranging from 16 to 17.75 for positive affect (PA) and from 13.75 to 15.5 
                            for negative affect (NA), with consistently higher PA scores. While not notably significant, some patterns emerged. 
                            Netflix had the highest PA (M=17.75, SD=5.91) and lowest NA (M=13.75, SD=5.56), aligning with Likert ratings. 
                            Galaxy projection had low NA (M=14.5, SD=5.07), contrasting its PA score (M=16, SD=0.82) and Likert results. 
                            Music matched Netflix's high PA score (M=17.75, SD=6.02). Inconsistencies and wide SDs may stem from the small 
                            sample. No modifications and meditation had the highest NA (M=15.5) with SD=5.92 and SD=4.04, respectively.</p>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                            <img src="img/mri_figure4.png" alt="mri-figure4" style="width: 60%;" />
                        </div>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                            <img src="img/mri_figure5.png" alt="mri-figure5" style="width: 60%;" />
                        </div>
                    <h4>Heart Rate</h4>
                        <p>Across the four participants, heart rates went down by an average of 4 beats per minute (BPM) from the first scan to 
                            the final scan (see Figure 6). However, heart rates did not always increase for the conditions participants rated 
                            poorly or decrease for the ones they rated highly.</p>
                    <h4>Interview Themes</h4>
                        <p>The following are the findings from the interviews conducted with the study participants:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comfort aids involving visuals were usually more comforting.</li>
                            <li>Participants tended not to favor the comfort aids involving audio.</li>
                            <li>Most participants found having no modifications very uncomfortable.</li>
                            <li>Participants got used to the MRI with practice.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h3 class="subheading">Discussion</h3>
                    <p>The findings contradicted the hypothesis that mindfulness-based strategies would outperform distraction-based 
                        strategies, revealing the opposite to be true.</p>
                    <p>The study revealed that all comfort aids improved the MRI experience compared to no aids, aligning with prior research. 
                        Netflix and the galaxy projector stood out as the most comforting, favoring visual distractions. Unexpectedly, the 
                        galaxy projection, meant for mindfulness, was valued for its distraction. Gazing at bore stars or galaxies increased 
                        comfort. In contrast, audio-based aids faced criticism for poor audibility. Netflix's visual-audio blend made it more 
                        bearable. Despite common patterns, individual preferences differed, indicating the lack of a one-size-fits-all answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the study indicated that participants felt subtly more at ease with practice in the mock scanner, 
                        suggesting its potential benefit. These findings suggest several implications for MRI facilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distraction-based aids may generally prove more effective than mindfulness strategies.</li>
                        <li>Among distraction-based aids, visual distractions might yield better results than audio distractions.</li>
                        <li>Mock MRI scanner practice can enhance patient comfort.</li>
                        <li>Allowing patients to explore various comfort aids prior to their scan could help identify the most suitable option 
                            for each individual.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 class="subheading">Limitations and Future Work</h3>
                    <p>Despite its contributions, this study has limitations, including the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small sample size (four participants).</li>
                        <li>Absence of pre-screening for high anxiety.</li>
                        <li>Simulation lacking key stress-inducing elements of real MRI situations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Medical necessity.</li>
                                <li>Longer scan times (45 minutes).</li>
                                <li>Presence of medical staff and radiologists.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Potential limited generalizability to specifically anxious patients.</li>
                        <li>Lack of exploration of combining mindfulness interventions with distraction techniques.</li>
                        <li>Limited scope to a simulated MRI experience, not a real MRI.</li>
                        <li>Possible variation between simulated and actual MRI settings.</li>
                        <li>Potential for differing effectiveness of comfort aids in various medical settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In response to these limitations, future investigations might try the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase sample size and target anxious individuals.</li>
                        <li>Enhance realism in MRI simulations.</li>
                        <li>Explore combination of mindfulness and distraction.</li>
                        <li>Survey MRI facilities and average scan disruptions.</li>
                        <li>Extend research to other medical settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 class="subheading">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="bottom-text">The findings showed that all types of comfort aids reduced patient discomfort, but that distraction was more effective 
                        than mindfulness. Furthermore, the most effective comfort aids used visual distraction. Despite these majority 
                        patterns, participants sometimes had different preferences. Finally, our results suggest that participants became more 
                        comfortable as they practiced being in the mock scanner.</p>
